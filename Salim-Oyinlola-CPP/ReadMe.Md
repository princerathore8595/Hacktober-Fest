
### bigger_number.cpp
Write a complete C++ Program that has a main function, a GetTwoNumbers
function and a FindBigOne function. The main calls the GetTwoNumbers functions,
which asks the user for two integers.
Then the program sends the two int's to FindBigOne, which returns the larger one
to main.
For example, if the user puts in 19 and 2, FindTheBigOne will return 19. If the two
numbers are the same, it will send back either one. Incorporate a loop in the main
function so that the user can keep entering two values as long as he or she desires

### quadratic_eqn.cpp
Write a C++ Program that calculates the roots of a quadratic equation given as
ax^2 + bx + c = 0. Create the following functions:
i. Get_Coefficients function that asks for the coefficient of the equatio using pointers.
ii. Calc_Discriminant function to check if the roots are real, imaginary or same.
If the root is real, imaginary or same, then Calc_discriminant returns "r", "i" or "s" respectively.
Based on the result of Calc_Discriminant function, call a Calc_Root function to calculate the
roots of the quadratic equation. Ask the user if he or she wishes to continue
and loop back if the answer is affirmative.

### standard-deviation.cpp
 Write a C++ program that calculates the standard deviation of five numbers using the
 knowledge of arrays and functions.
